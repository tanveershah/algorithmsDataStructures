# Welcome to Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS)

This repo provides solutions to common ADS questions. The programing language used in this repo is C#. Please feel free to contribute to this repo! You may also contact me via my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanveerhshah/).

# Algorithms

Algorithms are a sequence of steps to solve a specific problem.

## Classfication of Algorithms

- Serial/Parallel: Work on a dataset sequencially vs breaking the dataset into smaller pieces and work on them simultaneously.
- Exact/Approximate: An algorithm produces a known predictable value vs tries to find an answer that might or might not be exact.
- Deterministic/Non deterministic: Executing each step with an exact decision vs attemps to produce a solution with successive guesses and become more accurate over time.

## Types of Algorithms

- Search Algorithms: Find a specific data in a data.
- Computational Algoriths: Calculate a set of data from a given dataset.
- Sort Algorithms: Apply a sort order to a dataset.
- Collection Algorithms: Work with collections of data.

## Algorithm Complexity

- Space:
  How much memory an algorithm requires?
- Time:
  How much time an algorithm takes to complete?

## Big-O notation

Used to describe an algorithm performance as the input size grows. Here are common Big-O Terms:

- O(1) - Constant time, for example, accessing a single element in an array
- O(log n) - Logarithmic, for example, binary search in a sorted array
- O(n) - Linear, for example, searching an unsorted array
- O(n log n) - Log-Linear, for example, merge sort
- O(n2) - Quadratic, for example, buble sort, two nested loops

## Inputs and ouputs

Inputs are what an algorithm accepts and outputs are the results.

# Data Structures

Data Structures are used to organize data so it can be processed by alogrithms.

## Common Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash tables
